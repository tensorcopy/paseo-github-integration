/**
 * Hosts whose images the server fetches on the client's behalf. An attachment
 * on a private repository answers 404 without the `gh` token, and the token
 * lives on the daemon — the app never sees it. Anything else the app loads
 * itself: sending the daemon after an arbitrary URL from a comment anyone
 * could have written is a fetch nobody asked for.
 *
 * `github.com` is narrowed to the `/user-attachments/` prefix this proxy
 * exists to serve: the host check alone would let a comment's author pick
 * any `github.com` path and have the daemon fetch it carrying the account's
 * token, which is a forced authenticated request nobody asked the daemon to
 * make. `*.githubusercontent.com` needs no such narrowing — it is where
 * every other GitHub-hosted image, including raw content, actually lives.
 * The token one of its hops may carry is the github.com one, decided in
 * `server/images/images.ts`: the CDNs are github.com's own hosting, not
 * hosts `gh` is logged in to, and an Enterprise host's token never leaves
 * that host.
 *
 * A GitHub Enterprise host serves the same `/user-attachments/` paths, so it
 * is accepted under the same prefix — but only a host the account is actually
 * authenticated on, because that is the set the daemon holds a token for. The
 * caller supplies it; nothing here names any host itself, which is what keeps
 * the daemon's token inside the hosts the user chose to log in to.
