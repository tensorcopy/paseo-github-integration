 * Checks permission — a fine-grained PAT, typically — answers
 * `statusCheckRollup` with "Resource not accessible", and `gh api graphql`
 * treats any GraphQL error as a failed command. Asking for it inside the search
 * would turn that into a blank Draft PRs *and* Open PRs column; asking for it
 * separately costs pills nobody could have seen anyway.
 *
 * `nodes(ids:)` takes at most 100 ids, so `attachChecks` asks in batches of
 * that size rather than assuming the open pull requests fit in one.
